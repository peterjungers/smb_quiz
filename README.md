# Super Mario Bros. quiz  

This web app is a quiz containing ten questions, randomly chosen from a larger database I constructed, about Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2, and Super Mario Bros. 3â€”all for the Nintendo Entertainment System. All questions were written by me after extensive research, i.e., I played the games a lot :) I also built the sprite images using the [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com) web app, with the games themselves serving as reference.  

This was my first project built using the Django web framework.
